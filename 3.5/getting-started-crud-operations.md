# 2. CRUD Operations

---

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Let's bring back the example in our first lesson. The Tags CRUD:

![Tag CRUD - List Entries Operation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-3-5/getting_started/tag_crud_list_entries.png)

With its ```TagCrudController```:

```php
<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin;

use Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\CrudController;

// VALIDATION: change the requests to match your own file names if you need form validation
use App\Http\Requests\TagCrudRequest as StoreRequest;
use App\Http\Requests\TagCrudRequest as UpdateRequest;

class TagCrudController extends CrudController {

  public function setup() 
  {
      $this->crud->setModel("App\Models\Tag");
      $this->crud->setRoute("admin/tag");
      $this->crud->setEntityNameStrings('tag', 'tags');

      $this->crud->setColumns(['name', 'slug']);
      $this->crud->addField([
        'name' => 'name',
        'type' => 'text',
        'label' => "Tag name"
      ]);
      $this->crud->addField([
        'name' => 'slug',
        'type' => 'text',
        'label' => "URL Segment (slug)"
      ]);
  }

  public function store(StoreRequest $request)
  {
    return parent::storeCrud();
  }

  public function update(UpdateRequest $request)
  {
    return parent::updateCrud();
  }
}
```

By default, CRUDs have these operations already enabled:
- **Create** - using a create form (aka "*add form*")
- **ListEntries** - using AJAX DataTables (aka "*list view*", aka "*table view*")
- **Update** - using an update form (aka "*edit form*")
- **Delete** - using a *button* in the *list view* 

These are the basic operations an admin can execute on an Eloquent model, thanks to Backpack. We do have additional operations (Preview, Reorder, Revisions), and you can easily _create a custom operation_, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Baby steps. **Let's go through the most important features of the operations you'll be using _all the time_: ListEntries, Create and Update**.

<a name="create-and-update-operations"></a>
## Create & Update Operations

![Tag CRUD - Edit Operation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-3-5/getting_started/tag_crud_edit.png)

<a name="fields"></a>
### Fields

Inside your Controller's ```setup()``` method, you'll be able to define what fields you want the admin to see, when creating/updating entries. In the example above, we only have two fields, both using the ```text``` field type. So that's what's shown to the admin. When the admin presses _Save_, assuming your model has those two attributes as ```$fillable```, Backpack will save the entry and take you back to the ListEntries view. Keep in mind we're using a _pure_ Eloquent model. So of course, inside the model you could use accessors, mutators, events, etc.


But a lot of times, you won't just need text inputs. You'll need datepickers, upload buttons, 1-n relationship, n-n relationships, textareas, etc. For each field, you only need to define it properly in the Controller's ```setup()``` method. Here are the most used methods to manipulate fields:

```php
// You can pass a second parameter with the operation:
// - "create" for Create
// - "update" for Update
// - nothing (missing) for both Create and Update

$this->crud->addField($field_definition_array);
$this->crud->addFields([$field_definition_array_1, $field_definition_array_2]);
$this->crud->removeField('name');
$this->crud->removeFields(['name_1', 'name_2']);

// pro tip:
// a quick way to add simple fields: let the CRUD decide what field type it is
$this->crud->addField('db_column_name'); 
```

A typical *field definition array* will need at least three things:
- ```name``` - the attribute (column in the database), which will also become the name of the input;
- ```type``` - the kind of field we'd like to use (text, number, select2, etc);
- ```label``` - the human-readable label for the input (will be generated from ```name``` if not given);


You can use [one of the 44+ field types we've provided](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#default-field-types), or easily [create a custom field type](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#creating-a-custom-field-type) if you have some super-specific need that we haven't covered yet, or even [overwrite how a field type works](#overwriting-default-field-types). Take a few minutes and [browse the 44+ field types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-fields#default-field-types), to understand how the definition array differs from one to another and how many use cases you have already covered.

Let's take another example, slightly more complicated than the ```text``` fields we used above. Something you'll encounter all the time is relationship fields. So let's say the ```Tag``` model has an **n-n relationship** with an Article model:

```php
    public function articles()
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany('App\Models\Article', 'article_tag');
    }
```

We could use the code below to add a ```select2_multiple``` field to the Tag update forms:

```php
$this->crud->addField([
    'type' => 'select2_multiple',
    'name' => 'articles', // the relationship name in your Model
    'entity' => 'articles', // the relationship name in your Model
    'attribute' => 'title', // attribute on Article that is shown to admin
    'pivot' => true, // on create&update, do you need to add/delete pivot table entries?
], 'update');
```

**Notes:**
- Because of the last parameter ("_update_"), the field will only be added on the Update form (not on the Create);
- Because we haven't specified a ```label```, Backpack will take the "_articles_" name and turn it into a label: "_Articles_";

If we had an Articles CRUD, and the reverse relationship defined on the ```Article``` model too, we could also add a ```select2_multiple``` field in the Article CRUD, to allow the admin to choose which tags apply to each article. This actually makes more sense than the above :-)

```php
$this->crud->addField([
    'label' => "Tags",
    'type' => 'select2_multiple',
    'name' => 'tags', // the method that defines the relationship in your Model
    'entity' => 'tags', // the method that defines the relationship in your Model
    'attribute' => 'name', // foreign key attribute that is shown to user
    'pivot' => true, // on create&update, do you need to add/delete pivot table entries?
]);
```

**Note: **Because the last parameter is missing, the field will be added to both Create and Update forms.


> When generating a CrudController, you'll be using the ```$this->crud->setFromDb();``` method by default, which tries to figure out what fields you might need in your create/update forms and in your list view, but - as you'd expect - only works for the simple field types. You can:
> 
> (1) choose to keep using ```setFromDb()``` and add/remove/change additional fields
> 
>   or 
> 
> (2) delete ```setFromDb()``` and manually define each field and column;
> 
> **Our recommendation**, for anything but the simplest CRUDs, **is to manually define each field** - much easier to understand and customize, for your future self and any other developer that comes after you.

<a name="callbacks"></a>
### Callbacks

Developers coming from GroceryCRUD on CodeIgniter or other CRUD systems will be looking for callbacks to run ```before_insert```, ```before_update```, ```after_insert```, ```after_update```.

**There are no callbacks in Backpack**, because there's no need. The code for the create & update operations is out in the open for you to customize. Notice your EntityCrudController already has the following methods, which you can modify as you wish: 

```php
public function store(StoreRequest $request)
{
    // <---------  here is where a before_insert callback logic would be
    $response = parent::storeCrud();
    // <---------  here is where a after_insert callback logic would be
    return $response;
}

public function update(UpdateRequest $request)
{
    // <---------  here is where a before_update callback logic would be
    $response = parent::updateCrud();
    // <---------  here is where a after_update callback logic would be
    return $response;
}
```

But before you do that, ask yourself - *is this something that should be done when an entry is added/updated/deleted from the application, too*? Not just the admin admin? If so, a better place for it would be the Model. Remember your Model is a pure Eloquent Model, so the cleanest way might be to use [Eloquent Event Observers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/eloquent#events) or [accessors and mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators).

<a name="list-entries-operation"></a>
## ListEntries Operation

ListEntries shows the admin a table with all entries. On the front-end, the information is pulled using AJAX calls, and shown using DataTables. It's the most feature-packed operation in Backpack, but right now we're just going through the most important features you need to know about: columns, filters and buttons.

<a name="columns"></a>
### Columns

Columns help you specify *which* attributes are shown in the table and *in which order*. **They're defined in the ```setup()``` method, the same as fields, and their syntax is super-similar to fields too**:

```php
$this->crud->addColumn($column_definition_array); // add a single column, at the end of the table
$this->crud->addColumns([$column_definition_array_1, $column_definition_array_2]); // add multiple columns, at the end of the table
$this->crud->removeColumn('column_name'); // remove a column from the table
$this->crud->removeColumns(['column_name_1', 'column_name_2']); // remove an array of columns from the table
$this->crud->setColumnDetails('column_name', ['attribute' => 'value']);
$this->crud->setColumnsDetails(['column_1', 'column_2'], ['attribute' => 'value']);

$this->crud->setColumns([$column_definition_array_1, $column_definition_array_2]); // make these the only columns in the table
```

You can use one of the [14+ column types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-columns#default-column-types) to show information to the user in the table, or easily [create a custom column type](/docs/{{version}}/crud-columns#creating-a-custom-column-type), if you have a super-specific need. Here's an example of using the methods above:

```php
$this->crud->addColumn([
            'name' => 'published_at',
            'type' => 'date',
            'label' => 'Publish_date',
 ]);

// PRO TIP: to quickly add a text column, just pass the name string instead of an array
$this->crud->addColumn('text'); // adds a text column, at the end of the stack
```

### Filters

![Monster CRUD - List Entries Filters](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-3-5/getting_started/backpack_filters.png)

Filters provide an easy way for the admin to well… _filter_ the ListEntries table. The syntax is very similar to Fields and Columns and you can use one of the [existing 8 filter types](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters) or easily [create a custom filter](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters#creating-custom-filters). 

```php
$this->crud->addFilter($options, $values, $filter_logic);
$this->crud->removeFilter($name);
$this->crud->removeAllFilters();
```

For more on this, check out the [filters documentation page](/docs/{{version}}/crud-filters), when you need them.

<a name="buttons"></a>
### Buttons

![Tag CRUD - List Entries Buttons](https://backpackforlaravel.com/uploads/docs-3-5/getting_started/backpack_buttons.png)

If you want to add a custom button to an entry, you can do that. If you want to remove a button, you can also do that. Look for the [buttons documentation](/docs/{{version}}/crud-buttons) when you need it.  

```php
// positions: 'beginning' and 'end'
// stacks: 'line', 'top', 'bottom'
// types: view, model_function
$this->crud->addButton($stack, $name, $type, $content, $position);
$this->crud->removeButton($name);
$this->crud->removeButtonFromStack($name, $stack);
```

**That's it for today!** Thanks for sticking with us this long. This has been the most important and longest lesson.
