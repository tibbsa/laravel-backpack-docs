# Demo

---

We've put together a working Laravel backend app, that you can install on your machine. This should make it easier for see how it looks and works. You can even change stuff in code, to see how easy it is to customize Backpack. In this [Demo repository](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/demo), we've:
- installed Laravel 5.6;
- installed Backpack\Base and Backpack\CRUD on top;
- created a few demo models (Monsters, Icons, Products) and admin panels for them, using dozens of field types, column types, filters, etc - to show off most of Backpack's default features;
- installed a few Backpack extensions: PermissionManager, PageManager, LogManager, BackupManager, Settings, MenuCRUD, NewsCRUD;


>**Don't use this demo to start your real projects.** Please use [the recommended installation procedure](/docs/{{version}}/installation). You don't want all the bogus entities we've created. You don't want all the packages we've used. And you _definitely_ don't want the default admin user. Start from scratch.

## Installation

1) In your ```Projects``` or ```www``` directory, wherever you host your apps:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/demo.git backpack-demo
```

2) Set your database information in your ```.env``` file (use ```.env.example``` as an example);

3) Install all the requirements:
``` zsh
cd backpack-demo
composer install
```

4) Populate the database and stuff:
```zsh
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed --class="Backpack\Settings\database\seeds\SettingsTableSeeder"
php artisan db:seed
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage 

Once everything's installed, and your database has been set up:

- Your admin panel is available at http://localhost/backpack-demo/admin
- Login with email ```admin@example.com```, password ```admin```
- You can register a different account, to check out the process and see your gravatar inside the admin panel. 
- By default, registration is open only in your local environment. Check out ```config/backpack/base.php``` to change this and other preferences.
- Check out the Monsters admin panel - it features over 40 field types.
- The magic of Backpack is not in its standard functionality, but in how easy it is to code your own, then customize every little bit of it. Our recommendation:
    - Go through the [CRUD Tutorial](/docs/{{version}}/crud-tutorial) to understand it;
    - Create a new CRUD panel for an entity, using the faster procedure outlined at the end of that page; say... ```car```;


>**vhost configurations**
>
>Depending on your vhost configuration you might need to access the application via a different url, for example if you're using ```artisan serve``` you can access it on http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin - if you're using Laravel Valet, then it may look like http://backpack-demo.test/admin - you will need to access the url which matches your systems configuration. If you do not understand how to configure your virtual hosts, we suggest [watching Laracasts Episode #1](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch/episodes/1) to quickly get started.
