Backpack\CRUD provides a fast way to build administration panels - places where your administrators can Create, Read, Update, Delete entries for a specific Eloquent model. **One CRUD Panel provides functionality for one Eloquent Model.**

## Requirements

In order to create a CRUD Panel, you'll need:
- **a table in the database** (and maybe connection tables for relationships);
- **an Eloquent Model** that points to that db table;

If you don't already have the models, don't worry, Backpack also includes a faster way to generate database migrations and models.

## Architecture

A Backpack CRUD Panel uses _the same elements_ you would have created for an administration panel, if you were doing it from scratch:
- a **controller** - holds the logic for the all operations an admin can perform on that Eloquent model; will be generated in ```app/Http/Controllers/Admin```;
- a **request** file - used to validate Create and Update forms; will be generated in ```app/Http/Requests```;
- a resource **route** - points to the controller above; will be generated in ```routes/backpack/custom.php```;

**The only difference** between building it from scratch and using Backpack\CRUD** is that:
- your controller will be extending ```Backpack\CRUD\app\Http\Controllers\CrudController```**, which allow you to easily add traits that handle the most common operations: Create, Update, Delete, List, Show,  Reorder, Revisions. 
- your model will ```use \Backpack\CRUD\CrudTrait```;

This simple architecture (```ProductCrudController extends CrudController```) means:
- **your CRUD Panel will not be a _black box_**; you can easily see the logic for each operation, by checking the methods on this controller, or the traits you'll be using;
- **you can _easily_ overwrite what happens inside each operation**; 
- **you can _easily_ add custom operations**;

For example:
- want to change how a single ```Product``` is shown to the admin? just create a method called ```show()``` in your ```ProductCrudController```; simple OOP dictates that your method will be picked up, instead of the one in CrudController; some goes for ```create()```, ```store()```, etc - you have complete control;
- want to create a new "Publish" operation on a ```Product```? your ```ProductCrudController``` is a great place for that logic; just create a custom ```publish()``` method and a route that points to it;

## Files

For a ```Tag``` entity, your CRUD Panel would consist of:
- a controller (```app/Http/Controllers/Admin/TagCrudController.php```);
- a request (```app/Http/Requests/TagCrudRequest.php```);
- a route inside ```routes/backpack/custom.php```;
- your existing model (```app/Models/Tag.php```);
